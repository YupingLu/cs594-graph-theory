a is not true. The longest path is u-c-b-a-v, but the one we got using BFS is u-a-v (see pic 1)

b is not true. The longest cycle is u-c-b-a-v, but the one we got using BFS is u-a-v (see pic 1)












c is not true. The longest path is u-a-v, but the one we got is u-v (see pic 2)










d is not true. The longest cycle is u-c-b-a-v, but the one we got using DFS is u-a-v (see pic 3)
